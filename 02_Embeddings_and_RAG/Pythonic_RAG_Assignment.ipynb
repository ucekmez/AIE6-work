            "The best way to write a loop in Python often depends on the specific task you want to accomplish. Here are some common types of loops and best practices for each:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. For Loop\n",
            "A `for` loop is ideal for iterating over sequences (like lists, tuples, or strings) or objects that are iterable.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a for loop\n",
            "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
            "for fruit in fruits:\n",
            "    print(fruit)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "**Best Practices:**\n",
            "- Use descriptive variable names for better clarity.\n",
            "- If you need to access both index and value, consider using `enumerate()`:\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
            "    print(f\"{index}: {fruit}\")\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. While Loop\n",
            "A `while` loop is used when you want to repeat an action until a certain condition becomes false.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "# Example of a while loop\n",
            "count = 0\n",
            "while count < 5:\n",
            "    print(count)\n",
            "    count += 1\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "**Best Practices:**\n",
            "- Ensure that the loop has a condition that will eventually become false to avoid infinite loops.\n",
            "- Keep the loop body simple to maintain clarity.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Using Loop Control Statements\n",
            "You can use `break` to exit the loop early and `continue` to skip the current iteration and move to the next.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "for number in range(10):\n",
            "    if number == 5:\n",
            "        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5\n",
            "    print(number)\n",
            "\n",
            "for number in range(5):\n",
            "    if number == 2:\n",
            "        continue  # Skip the rest of the loop body\n",
            "    print(number)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. List Comprehensions\n",
            "For creating lists, consider using list comprehensions, which can be more succinct and often faster than traditional loops.\n",
            "\n",
            "```python\n",
            "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
            "print(squares)\n",
            "```\n",
            "\n",
            "### Summary\n",
            "- Choose `for` loops for known iterations and `while` loops for conditions.\n",
            "- Use `enumerate()` for accessing index and value in a `for` loop.\n",
            "- Avoid infinite loops in `while`.\n",
            "- Utilize list comprehensions for concise list creation.\n",
            "\n",

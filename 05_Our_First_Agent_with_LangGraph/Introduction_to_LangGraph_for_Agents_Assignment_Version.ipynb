QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

However, the high computational and memory\\nrequirements of LLMs are a major bottleneck. To address this,\\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as low-rank adaptation\\n(LoRA) have been proposed to reduce computational costs while ensuring minimal\\nloss in performance. Additionally, knowledge distillation (KD) has been a\\npopular choice for obtaining compact student models from teacher models. In\\nthis work, we present KD-LoRA, a novel fine-tuning method that combines LoRA\\nwith KD. Our results demonstrate that KD-LoRA achieves performance comparable\\nto full fine-tuning (FFT) and LoRA while significantly reducing resource\\nrequirements. Specifically, KD-LoRA retains 98% of LoRA's performance on the\\nGLUE benchmark, while being 40% more compact. Additionally, KD-LoRA reduces GPU\\nmemory usage by 30% compared to LoRA, while decreasing inference time by 30%\\ncompared to both FFT and LoRA. We evaluate KD-LoRA across three encoder-only\\nmodels: BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3.

However, it still faces resource consumption challenges\\nduring training when scaling up to larger models. Most previous studies have\\ntackled this issue by using pruning techniques, which involve removing LoRA\\nparameters deemed unimportant. Nonetheless, these efforts only analyze LoRA\\nparameter features to evaluate their importance, such as parameter count, size,\\nand gradient. In fact, the output of LoRA (product of LoRA parameter and hidden\\nstate), directly impacts the final results. Preliminary experiments indicate\\nthat a fraction of LoRA elements possesses significantly high output values,\\nsubstantially influencing the layer output. Motivated by the observation, we\\npropose LoRA-drop. Concretely, LoRA-drop evaluates the importance of LoRA based\\non the LoRA output. Then we retain LoRA for important layers and the other\\nlayers share the same LoRA. We conduct abundant experiments with models of\\ndifferent scales on NLU and NLG tasks. Results demonstrate that LoRA-drop can\\nachieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning and LoRA, while retaining\\n50\\\\% of the LoRA parameters on average.\", name='arxiv', id='795f8c10-350c-42f0-ab1e-2e267f691a66', tool_call_id='call_e4j3BF764lR47FcwIvmesw2m'), ToolMessage(content='Published: 2019-08-23\\nTitle: Sparse Networks from Scratch: Faster Training without Losing Performance\\nAuthors: Tim Dettmers, Luke Zettlemoyer\\nSummary: We demonstrate the possibility of what we call sparse learning: accelerated\\ntraining of deep neural networks that maintain sparse weights throughout\\ntraining while achieving dense performance levels. We accomplish this by\\ndeveloping sparse momentum, an algorithm which uses exponentially smoothed\\ngradients (momentum) to identify layers and weights which reduce the error\\nefficiently. Sparse momentum redistributes pruned weights across layers\\naccording to the mean momentum magnitude of each layer. Within a layer, sparse\\nmomentum grows weights according to the momentum magnitude of zero-valued\\nweights. We demonstrate state-of-the-art sparse performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10,\\nand ImageNet, decreasing the mean error by a relative 8%, 15%, and 6% compared\\nto other sparse algorithms. Furthermore, we show that sparse momentum reliably\\nreproduces dense performance levels while providing up to 5.61x faster\\ntraining. In our analysis, ablations show that the benefits of momentum\\nredistribution and growth increase with the depth and size of the network.\\nAdditionally, we find that sparse momentum is insensitive to the choice of its\\nhyperparameters suggesting that sparse momentum is robust and easy to use.\\n\\nPublished: 2016-02-19\\nTitle: 8-Bit Approximations for Parallelism in Deep Learning\\nAuthors: Tim Dettmers\\nSummary: The creation of practical deep learning data-products often requires\\nparallelization across processors and computers to make deep learning feasible\\non large data sets, but bottlenecks in communication bandwidth make it\\ndifficult to attain good speedups through parallelism. Here we develop and test\\n8-bit approximation algorithms which make better use of the available bandwidth\\nby compressing 32-bit gradients and nonlinear activations to 8-bit\\napproximations. We show that these approximations do not decrease predictive\\nperformance on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet for both model and data parallelism\\nand provide a data transfer speedup of 2x relative to 32-bit parallelism. We\\nbuild a predictive model for speedups based on our experimental data, verify\\nits validity on known speedup data, and show that we can obtain a speedup of\\n50x and more on a system of 96 GPUs compared to a speedup of 23x for 32-bit. We\\ncompare our data types with other methods and show that 8-bit approximations\\nachieve state-of-the-art speedups for model parallelism. Thus 8-bit\\napproximation is an efficient method to parallelize convolutional networks on\\nvery large systems of GPUs.\\n\\nPublished: 2022-06-20\\nTitle: 8-bit Optimizers via Block-wise Quantization\\nAuthors: Tim Dettmers, Mike Lewis, Sam Shleifer, Luke Zettlemoyer\\nSummary: Stateful optimizers maintain gradient statistics over time, e.g., the\\nexponentially smoothed sum (SGD with momentum) or squared sum (Adam) of past\\ngradient values. This state can be used to accelerate optimization compared to\\nplain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be\\nallocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models\\ntrained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use\\n8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit\\noptimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and\\nstability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise\\nquantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently\\nquantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster\\noptimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and\\nperformance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes:\\n(1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for\\nboth large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to\\nreduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribut', name='arxiv', id='90363f25-cd51-4c1b-82a9-258e42a7bf3b', tool_call_id='call_XZ7EVtZHYDeZ7wocM61RpYgE'), ToolMessage(content=\"Published: 2023-09-15\\nTitle: Attention-Only Transformers and Implementing MLPs with Attention Heads\\nAuthors: Robert Huben, Valerie Morris\\nSummary: The transformer architecture is widely used in machine learning models and\\nconsists of two alternating sublayers: attention heads and MLPs.
